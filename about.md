## About Me
I am deeply fascinated by innovative data analytic tools and technologies for resolving complex data-scientific problems and the prospect of the transformational power of actionable insights derived from big data to economic entities and the globe at large. 

### My Professional Life...
I am an accomplished Data Analyst with more than nine years of professional experience in handling, managing and analyzing data for various projects in Malawi. I have a successful  proven track record in project monitoring and evaluation, analyzing large datasets, setting up automated data processes, designing and carrying out surveys, and monitoring and auditing data quality.

Currently, I am working as Project Coordinator for the Local Organization Network for Tuberculosis Response (TB LON II) Project in Malawi. Before this position, I have worked as a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist for TB LON II at DAPP Malawi and Plan International Malawi for more than six years. I have had an opportunity to work with some research institutions and independent research consultants including Center for Agriculture Research and Development (CARD), where I worked as Field Research Manager for about a year.

I'm enthusiastic about Data Science, especially considering how quickly technology is changing the profession. I enjoy being a part of new technologies and trying out innovative solutions and automations. 

### My Education
#### An Overview 
I hold an MA in Economics from the University of Malawi and BSc in Agricultural Economics from Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources in Malawi. Currently, pursuing a MSc in Data Science at the University of Essex online. 
#### My Journey to being a Data Scientist  
I studied BSc in Agricultural Economics at Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) formerly known as the University of Malawi, Bunda College of agriculture. During this time, I developed an interest in advancing my knowledge and skills in quantitative research method and statistical modeling. Further to my interest, I researched the determinants of agricultural information access by smallholder farmers, which I used the Probit Model to estimate the parameters that determined access to information. 

After my BSc, I undertook a Masters in Economics at University Malawi, Chancellor College. From this course, I gained a deeper knowledge of the quantitative research methods, which I made use of in my thesis on the living standard of smallholder farm households in relation to living income benchmark. My aim throughout this research project was to evaluate what it takes for a smallholder tea farm household in rural Malawi to live a ‘decent’ life by simulating various what-if scenarios. The word ‘decent life’ used as a basket of staple goods and services that provide the level utility for the households, which can be reflected by the local perception for decency.

As someone with a background in Economics, I have had an opportunity to work on multiple data management and related tasks. As technology advances and data evolve, I realise the need to go beyond the traditional data analysis approaches so as to cope with the evolution. Moving away from traditional data analysis would mean acquiring a new set of skills that would allow for utilizing my domain knowledge in economics and statistics with new knowledge in machine learning, advanced analytics and computing. For this reason, I am pursuing a MSc in Data Science at the University of Essex (Colchester, UK) online.I genuinely believe data science is the future.
